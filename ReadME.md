# üåç Travel Smart AI ‚Äì Multimodal Multi-Agent Travel Planner

A Google ADK-based multi-agent system that takes a user‚Äôs travel goal (e.g., ‚ÄúIs Bali safe to visit next week?‚Äù), breaks it into subtasks, and routes data between intelligent agents to generate a rich, multimodal travel readiness report ‚Äî including safety, weather, news, and image highlights.

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Multi-Agent Architecture using Google ADK principles
‚úÖ Goal-driven planning from natural language
‚úÖ Flask API backend with REST endpoints
‚úÖ Weather Forecast from OpenWeatherMap API
‚úÖ Safety & News Headlines via NewsAPI
‚úÖ Location-based Image Summary via Unsplash API
‚úÖ Synthesized final travel report with text + images
‚úÖ Modular design ‚Äî each agent is independently testable

## üß† How It Works

1. **User enters a travel goal**, e.g.:

   > ‚ÄúI want to travel to Bali next week. Is it safe? What‚Äôs the weather like? Show me some highlights.‚Äù

2. The **Planning Agent** splits this into tasks:

   * Get location and date
   * Check safety via news
   * Get 7-day weather forecast
   * Fetch latest related images
   * Combine and summarize

3. Each **agent executes in sequence**, enriching the result.

4. Final output is a **well-structured travel readiness report** with weather, news, and image summaries.
